Course Description: This course is an introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms, including sorting,
graph algorithms, searching, string algorithms, and data compression. The course concentrates on the algorithms’
developing implementations, understanding their performance characteristics, and estimating their potential
effectiveness in applications.
Lecture slides come from Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne of Princeton. Only for teaching and learning.
Prerequisites: A strong understanding of programming in JAVA and a solid background in discrete mathematics
are necessary prerequisites to this course.

Class Schedule: 1-4, 6-11 Thursday (1 – 2, 3 – 4) 信远 I-415.
Credits: 2.5

Textbook: Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne, Algorithms 4th Edition, Posts &Telecom Press (人民邮电出版

Course Goals: The two main goals of this course are to gain fundamentals knowledge in algorithms. This is
achieved by learning a set of classical algorithms to for abstract problem solving, containing sorting, searching,
graph algorithms and string algorithms, understanding the underlying math, other properties of these algorithms, 
time and space complexity analysis, and understanding how well an algorithm is performing in practice, and to
adapt and combine algorithms creatively to solve problems that may arise in practice.
Homework: There will be regularly scheduled homework sets due at TBA time on the due date. Homework will
be assigned the day of the class, and will be due the following week (unless stated otherwise). Each given problem
set must be written on a separate, one-sided A4-like sheet of paper, with the student's name and number,
homework number and problem number on top.
Late Policy: Please remember to submit your homework before the deadline. If you require an extension, we will
need to know in advance and you must have a good reason for needing it.
Academic Integrity: Students are expected to submit their own original homework. For programming, standard
and publicly available code libraries may be used in a restricted way in your programming assignments. Copying
another student's homework or code is considered cheating.
